Prerequisites In order to ship UPS SurePost shipments, the UPS
Account/Shipper Number you wish must have the appropriate SurePost
contracts. You will need to contact your UPS Account
Representative to get these contracts on your account in order to
ship SurePost. Once SurePost is active for your account, UPS will
send you the Mailer ID. The Mailer ID is needed to request a
SurePost shipping label.
